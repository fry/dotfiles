# vim-airline

lean &amp; mean statusline for vim that's light as air

# rationale

there's already [powerline][b], why yet another statusline?

*  it's standard vimscript, no python needed
*  it's small.  i want the entire plugin to be less than 200 lines as a rule
*  it gets you 90% of the way there; in addition to all the standard goodies, it integrates with [vim-bufferline][f], [fugitive][d], and [syntastic][e]
*  it looks good with regular fonts, and provides configuration points so you can use unicode or powerline symbols
*  it's fast to load, taking only 0.5ms.  by comparison, powerline needs 60ms on the same machine.

# why's it called airline?

i wrote this on an airplane, and since it's light as air it turned out to be a good name.  thanks for flying vim!

# configuration

`:help airline`

# faq

1.  the powerline font symbols are not showing up
  *  the older deprecated [vim-powerline][a] uses different codes compared to the newer [powerline][b].
  *  you can grab prepatched fonts at [powerline-fonts][c], or you can manually set the relevant `g:` variables
2.  there is a pause when leaving insert mode
  *  you need to set `ttimeoutlen` to a low number; 50 is recommended
3.  the colors don't change
  *  ensure that `set t_Co=256` is set in your vimrc
4.  you get the error `Unknown function: fugitive#head`
  *  you are probably using version 1.2, which is very old...download v2 from the [project page][d].
